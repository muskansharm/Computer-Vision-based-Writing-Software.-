Soft Board is an application that enables user to write on screen just by waving in air using any of the 2 
hands. This project also has a better hand tracking system than the existing ones by the use of media 
pipe. The core functionality utilizes 21 hand landmarks to recognize hands and 
track their movement on a per-frame basis.
